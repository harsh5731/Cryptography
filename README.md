# Cryptography

Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table 
This makes the cipher less vulnerable to cryptanalysis using letter frequencies. 
Blaise de Vigenère developed what is now called the Vigenère cipher in 1585. 
He used a table known as the Vigenère square, to encipher messages.

Input: Plaintext: INDIA 
Key: AYUSH 
Output: ILXAH 

	 	Polybius Square Cipher 
A Polybius Square is a table that allows someone to convert letters into numbers. To make the encryption little harder, this table can be randomized and shared with the recipient. In order to fit the 26 letters of the alphabet into the 25 cells created by the table, the letters ‘i’ and ‘j’ are usually combined into a single cell. Originally there was no such problem because the ancient Greek alphabet has 24 letters. A table of bigger size could be used if a language contain large number of alphabets.

Input: BUS 
Output: 124543 
Now, this both two Vigenere and Polybius cipher will be done summation and combination for formation of hybrid cipher system. This combination makes use of alphabetic substitution that is vigenere Cipher and polyalphabetic Numerical Cipher that is Polybius Square Cipher which make the message and plain text to encrypted message which is very confusing, unstructured and diffused that cannot be easier to break.
